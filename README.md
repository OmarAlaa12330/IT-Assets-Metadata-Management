Sprint 3 - 
Postman is giving error 415 , unsupported media type 
Data is not being inserted into tables in pgadmin , however the error that is shown in post man is also shown on the front end - therefore the front end and backend have been connected successfully.
In this sprint it will be about sorting the database and tables , hence the little to no commits as the code is not the issue.

Sprint 3 - 
Postman is giving error 415 , unsupported media type 
Data is not being inserted into tables in pgadmin , however the error that is shown in post man is also shown on the front end - therefore the front end and backend have been connected successfully.
In this sprint it will be about sorting the database and tables , hence the little to no commits as the code is not the issue. 


26/02/2024 - 
Changed pgadmin table , deleted and ran the code again that has been merged to pernal feature branch , this created new table in pgadmin with the correct inputs , so type and assets are currently seperated
NEXT - need to hard code certain data within the app class so that all data is added to the database 
Current error is data missing which is reffering to certain field which are not beong asked for as they are taken from the type

29/02/2024 - 
Postman works correctly to insert data via the add asset method within the backend assetConntroller class , however frontend is stating missing data still , attempt to hardcode data has not worked and only brought more errors.
